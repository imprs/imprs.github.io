Hello,

In this video you will get an idea about how to install ROS on your Ubuntu system. Here I have installed ROS Hydro on my Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise) but if you are on 12.10 (Quantal) or 13.04 (Raring) then it is for you.
In the next video I will give you some basic idea about navigating files, nodes, topics and messages.

You can find the link for the ROS installation page <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Ubuntu" target="blank">here</a>.

If you face any issues in the installation or want to say something to me then I'd love to hear from you.
