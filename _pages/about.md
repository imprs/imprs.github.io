I am a Research Assistant at the [Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems Research (L-CAS)](https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/), University of Lincoln, UK where my advisors are [Dr. Grzegorz Cielniak](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/gcielniak) and [Prof. Marc Hanheide](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/mhanheide). Currently, I'm involved in the project GRASPberry for autonomous strawberry harvesting.

Before joining L-CAS, I was part of the Autonomous Indoor Vehicles (AIV) team at [The Hi-Tech Robotic Systemz Ltd (THRSL)](https://www.hitechroboticsystemz.com/), India.

I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [Gujarat Technological University (GTU)](https://www.gtu.ac.in/), Ahmedabad.
