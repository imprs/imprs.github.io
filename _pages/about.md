I am an MSc (by Research) student in Computer Science (with a focus on robotics) at the [Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems Research (L-CAS)](https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/), University of Lincoln (UK), where I am working with [Dr. Grzegorz Cielniak](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/gcielniak) and [Prof. Marc Hanheide](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/mhanheide).

Prior to that, I was a Research Assistant at L-CAS with Dr. Grzegorz and Prof. Marc.

Before joining L-CAS, I was part of the Autonomous Indoor Vehicles (AIV) team at [The Hi-Tech Robotic Systemz Ltd (THRSL)](https://www.hitechroboticsystemz.com/) (India), where I mainly worked on autonomous navigation and perception for Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs).

I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [Gujarat Technological University (GTU)](https://www.gtu.ac.in/), Ahmedabad.
