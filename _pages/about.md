Namaste! I am Pratik. I am a Robotics Software Engineer at the [Oxford Robotics Institute (ORI)](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford (UK), where I work on projects related to responsible AI for autonomous systems and brain computer interfaces.

I did my MSc (by Research) in Computer Science (with a focus on robotics) at the [Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems Research (L-CAS)](https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/), University of Lincoln (UK), where I worked with [Dr. Grzegorz Cielniak](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/gcielniak), [Prof. Marc Hanheide](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/mhanheide), and [Dr. Riccardo Polvara](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/rpolvara).

Prior to that, I was a research assistant at L-CAS with Dr. Grzegorz and Prof. Marc.

Before joining L-CAS, I was part of the Autonomous Indoor Vehicles (AIV) team at [The Hi-Tech Robotic Systemz Ltd (THRSL)](https://www.hitechroboticsystemz.com/) (India), where I mainly worked on autonomous navigation and perception for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs).

I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [Gujarat Technological University (GTU)](https://www.gtu.ac.in/), Ahmedabad.
