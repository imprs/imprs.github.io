Project year: 2017-18

At The Hi-Tech Robotic Systemz Ltd (THRSL), I developed the obstacle_detection package that fused the information from a camera, LIDAR and ultrasound sensors and used Point Cloud Library (PCL) to detect obstacles and provide safety to our autonomous mobile robots. It was the standard package across AMRs developed by THRSL, and it is running on 20+ robots operating worldwide.
