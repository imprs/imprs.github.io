##### I worked on different things in this project. Some of them are:

<br>

##### Low-level control interface for the manipulator

Developed the low-level control interface using CANOpen (along with Dr. Grzegorz Cielniak who provided amazing base code!) for the manipulator and integrated it with the ROS ecosystem using ros_control. I also worked with a colleague to integrate the manipulator with Moveit!.

<br>

##### Integration of motion planning and scheduling package 

In another project, I worked with one of my colleagues to refactor their work and integrate with the project code. I also added some visualizations (e.g., arm workspace, planned and actual path) as you can see in the video. Moreover, I slighly helped another colleague to develop realtistic strawberry models in ROS/ Gazebo which can be used to simulate the grasping scenario in Gazebo.

##### Software management

During the project, I also contributed to the software management for the multile packages in the project repository.
